A to-do list is a tool used for organizing tasks that need to be completed. It typically consists of a written or digital list where individual tasks are noted down, often with checkboxes beside each item. Users can mark tasks as complete once they have been finished. To-do lists help with productivity by keeping track of responsibilities, prioritizing tasks, and ensuring that nothing is forgotten. They can be as simple or as detailed as needed, sometimes including deadlines, categories, or levels of priority to further streamline task management.
